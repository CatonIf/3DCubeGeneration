		<h1>Topdown TypeScript Redstone</h2>
		<text>
			One of the projects I made and I'm proud of is a Nuclear Throne mod, that adds a topdown variant of Minecraft's redstone to the game. I knew it would have been absolutely useless, but it was a fun idea, interesting to program, optimize and port to TypeScript, which is the version you are currently seeing.<br/>
			The avaliable pieces are:</br>
			<ul>
				<li>dust <img src="img/dust0.png"/></li>
				<li>lever <div id="lever" style="display: inline;"></div></li>
				<li>torch <img src="img/torch.png"/></li>
				<li>block <img src="img/block.png"/></li>
				<li>piston <img src="img/piston00.png"/></li>
			</ul>
			The only difference with the NT mod is that torches aren't there, there are just levers switched on.<br/>
			<br/>
			Torches, levers and powered dusts power adiacent non-powered dusts and pistons.<br/>
			When powered, piston push the piece in from of him, and all the pieces behind it, and when it pulls back it also makes all the pieces in line stick.<br/>
			Blocks are not affected by but can still be pushed by pistons, like all the other pieces.<br/><br/>
			<div id="pistonTutorial"></div><br/>
			A piston cannot be powered from the direction that he is supposed to push to.<br/><br/>
			<div id="pistonTutorial2"></div><br/>
			Those were the main rules that the simulation follows. There are not many things that it can do, but one of those is an AND gate:<br/><br/>
			<div id="andGate"></div><br/>
			And if it can do that, it can also do a calculator.<br/><br/>
			<div id="4bFA"></div><br/>
			This one can calculate the sum of two numbers from 0 to 15. It was actually "generated" by the GetFA function in the <a href="index.js">index.js</a> that I just ran on your browser. Just by changing the function's parameter from 4 to 8, the calculator will be able to add together numbers up to 255.
